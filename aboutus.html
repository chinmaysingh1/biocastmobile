                <h2>CHINMAY SINGH</h2>
                <p>Hi guys! I’m Chinmay Singh, an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I’ve loved public speaking and biology for as long as I can remember and am always looking for ways to further my knowledge in the field, as well as inform and teach others. Because of this, I started BioCast in hopes of motivating others to learn more about a topic I love. I look forward to speaking to you soon!

                <p>Hi everyone, I’m Parth Shirolkar, an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I listen to plenty of podcasts during my own time, and thus created BioCast as a means to reach out and share my own interests with the community. I thoroughly love biology, and can’t wait to bring you new perspectives and information about the field!
